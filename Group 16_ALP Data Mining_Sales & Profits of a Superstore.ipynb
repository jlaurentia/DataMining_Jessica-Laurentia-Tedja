Although the lift value is slightly above 1, this indicates a positive complementary relationship, suggesting that customers often upgrade or complete their living or office setup with communication devices.\n",
        "* **Rule 2: Phones → Furnishings** : This reverse rule reinforces the pattern that phone buyers frequently add furnishings to their baskets. This behavior may reflect customers setting up workspaces, home offices, or upgrading multiple aspects of their environment in a single shopping trip.\n",

This suggests a segment of customers interested in aesthetic and creative products who also invest in communication or digital tools, possibly for creative work, content creation, or lifestyle enhancement.\n",

Product categories that are frequently purchased together, such as **furnishings, phones, art, and storage**, should be placed in **close proximity to support workspace and lifestyle setup missions**, while **appliances, binders, and paper** should be **grouped** into a **dedicated office essentials area**. The company is encouraged to introduce **bundled promotions** and **cross-category discounts** to **increase average basket size and strengthen cross-selling opportunities.**\n",
